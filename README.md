# MultiDoggof *
*) Project name

Since it's hard to find good new LAN games anymore one must do it themselves. Inspired by WW2 aircraft carrier warfare, 5v5 MOBA gameplay and BattleBit's casual take on the milsim genre.

Initial locked in goals before adding major new ones:
- DONE Basic networking
- DONE Lobby
- DONE Teams
- DONE Spawning of players
- DONE Movement synced over network. (MOVED TO FUTURE TODO: Simplify movement)
- DONE Fog of war
- DONE Reconnaissance action
- DONE Visible ghosts of acquired information
- STARTED Basic objectives
- DONE Attack action
- Scorekeeping
- BUGGY Return to lobby

bugs important to fix:
	- postgame 2p only client gets both players' data and launches alone

tweaks that feel important:
	- BUGGY mission effect area needs a visual cue (things don't always appear)


Phase 1.1: for the first playtest
- DONE Round timers
- DONE Resources (fuels,munitions)
- PARTLY Needs HUD as well

Phase 2: Proper restructuring and cleanup of code
