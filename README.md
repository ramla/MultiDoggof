# MultiDoggof *
*) Project name

Since it's hard to find good new LAN games anymore one must do it themselves. Inspired by WW2 aircraft carrier warfare, 5v5 MOBA gameplay and BattleBit's casual take on the milsim genre.

Initial locked in goals before adding major new ones:
- DONE Basic networking
- DONE Lobby
- DONE Teams
- DONE Spawning of players
- DONE Movement synced over network. (MOVED TO FUTURE TODO: Simplify movement)
- DONE Fog of war
- DONE Reconnaissance action
- DONE Visible ghosts of acquired information
- Basic objectives
- BUGGY Attack action
- Scorekeeping
- Return to lobby

bugs important to fix:
	- receiving end sees no damage information, only the effect of incapacitation
tweaks that feel important:
	- mission effect area needs a visual cue


Phase 1.1: for the first playtest
- Round timers
- DONE Resources (fuels,munitions)
- PARTLY Needs HUD as well
