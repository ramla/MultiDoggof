# MultiDoggof *
*) Project name

Since it's hard to find good new LAN games anymore one must do it themselves. Inspired by WW2 aircraft carrier warfare, 5v5 MOBA gameplay and BattleBit's casual take on the milsim genre.

Initial locked in goals before adding major new ones:
- DONE Basic networking
- DONE Lobby
- DONE Teams
- DONE Spawning of players
- DONE Movement synced over network. (MOVED TO FUTURE TODO: Simplify movement)
- DONE Fog of war
- DONE Reconnaissance action
- DONE Visible ghosts of acquired information
- DONE? Basic objectives
	decide on priority mechanics and implement it
- DONE Attack action
- MOSTLY DONE Scorekeeping
- BUGGY Return to lobby

bugs important to fix:
	- DONE postgame 2p only client gets both players' data and launches alone
	- DONE launch countdown in lobby needs to be interrupted on anyone's team change or hesitation
tweaks that feel important:
	- Â½DONE mission effect area needs a visual cue (need to implement for attack as well)


Phase 1.1: for the first playtest
- DONE Round timers
- DONE Resources (fuels,munitions)
- DONE Needs HUD as well

Phase 2: Proper restructuring and cleanup of code
